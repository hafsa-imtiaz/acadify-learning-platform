Acadify Learning Platform — MVP Feature List

Overview:
The MVP enables public browsing of courses, user authentication (student and teacher), course enrollment, course content access (lessons and basic quizzes/assignments), assignment submission and grading, basic dashboards for students and teachers, and essential account settings. Focus on secure, tested, and deployable features.

PRIORITIES: High = must-have for MVP; Medium = valuable but not blocking; Low = optional for MVP.

   - Frontend: /courses/create, /courses/edit/:courseId
   - Backend: POST/PUT /api/courses, POST /api/courses/:id/modules, POST /api/courses/:id/lessons
 - Assignment creation & management
   - Acceptance: Teacher creates assignments with deadlines and upload resources; assignment appears for enrolled students
   - Backend: POST /api/courses/:id/assignments
 - View & grade submissions
   - Acceptance: Teacher sees submissions list, opens submissions, grades and leaves feedback; grades stored and visible to student
   - Backend: GET /api/assignments/:id/submissions, POST /api/submissions/:submissionId/grade
 - Class management (optional MVP minimal)
   - Acceptance: Add/remove students manually (optional for MVP), view roster
   - Backend: POST /api/courses/:id/students (optional)

5) Shared / Utility Features (High/Medium)
 - 404 and error pages (High)
 - Notifications (in-app basic) (Medium)
 - Search across courses (Medium)
 - Logout flow (High)
 - Terms/Privacy page (Low)

6) Backend & Data Models (High)
 - User model: roles (student/teacher), basic profile, auth fields
 - Course model: title, description, instructor(s), modules, published flag, tags
 - Module & Lesson models: order, content type (video, text, file), resources
 - Assignment & Submission models: deadline, attachments, grade, feedback
 - Basic audit fields: createdAt, updatedAt
 - Acceptance: data readable/writable via secure REST endpoints, migrations or seeders for sample data

7) Security & Infrastructure (High)
 - Fix critical vulnerabilities (multer limits, qs, form-data, axios, react-router etc.)
 - Input validation & sanitization for all endpoints (express-validator or equivalent)
 - File upload limits & validation (multer options and error handling)
 - Rate limiting (basic throttling on auth and upload endpoints)
 - HTTPS ready config for deployment

8) Testing & Quality (High)
 - Unit tests for critical backend logic (auth, enrollment, submissions)
 - Integration tests for key flows (register/login, enroll, submit assignment, grade)
 - Basic frontend tests for critical components and routes
 - Lint and formatting (ESLint, Prettier) integrated into CI

9) DevOps & CI/CD (Medium)
 - CI pipeline running lint, tests, and build (GitHub Actions or equivalent)
 - Deploy scripts or docs for deploying frontend and backend (staging & production)
 - Health checks and basic monitoring logs

10) Performance & UX (Medium)
 - Lazy load course content where feasible (lessons, videos)
 - Responsive design and accessibility basics (WCAG basics)
 - Basic caching for course listing endpoints

11) Acceptance criteria for MVP
 - Visitor can browse and preview courses without login
 - User can register/login as student or teacher
 - Student can enroll in a course and access course content after enrolling
 - Teacher can create a course, add lessons and assignments, and grade submissions
 - Assignment submissions can be uploaded and graded; grades visible to students
 - Basic profile management and logout
 - App builds and runs locally; tests pass in CI

12) Optional / Stretch (Low)
 - Quizzes with auto grading
 - Payments/checkout for paid courses
 - Discussions or comments in course pages
 - Certificates generation/export
 - Analytics dashboards with advanced metrics

Notes & next steps:
 - Prioritize implementing authentication, enrollments, course content gating, assignment submission/grade flows, and fixing high-severity security findings.
 - Create issues/tasks in repo for each high-priority item and assign owners/estimates.

If you want, I can turn each high-priority item into GitHub issues and open a task PR with an initial checklist and skeleton endpoints/components.
